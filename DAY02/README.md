/ NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to manage and share JavaScript packages (libraries or modules) and helps developers easily install, update, and manage project dependencies.

// Key Features:
// Package Management: Install, update, and remove Node.js packages.
// Dependency Management: Automatically handles and tracks package dependencies in the package.json file.
// Publishing Packages: Allows developers to share and publish their own packages to the npm registry.
// Common Commands:
// npm init – Initialize a new Node.js project.
// npm install <package> – Install a package locally.
// npm install -g <package> – Install a package globally.
// npm update – Update installed packages.
// It comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node automatically installs npm.



// A bundler is a tool that combines (or "bundles") multiple files, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and images, into a single or a few optimized files for better performance in web applications. It helps improve loading speed, manage dependencies, and optimize code for production.

// Key Functions of a Bundler:
// Combining Files: Merges multiple source files into fewer output files.
// Minification: Reduces file size by removing unnecessary characters (like spaces and comments).
// Code Splitting: Splits code into smaller chunks to load only what's needed.
// Tree Shaking: Removes unused code to reduce bundle size.
// Asset Management: Handles images, fonts, and other assets.
// Popular Bundlers:
// Webpack: Highly configurable and widely used for JavaScript applications.
// Parcel: Zero-config bundler known for its simplicity and speed.
// Vite: Fast bundler optimized for modern JavaScript frameworks (like React and Vue).
// Rollup: Focuses on creating optimized bundles for libraries and applications.


A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content (such as images, videos, scripts, and other assets) to users based on their geographic location. This helps improve website performance, speed, and reliability by reducing the distance between the server and the user.

How a CDN Works:
Caching Content: Stores copies of web content on multiple servers across the globe.
Routing Requests: Delivers content from the nearest server to the user, reducing load time.
Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
Benefits of Using a CDN:
Faster Load Times: Delivers content from the closest server.
Reduced Server Load: Offloads traffic from the main server.
Improved Reliability: Minimizes downtime and handles traffic spikes.
Global Reach: Provides consistent performance across different regions.
Examples of CDN Providers:
Cloudflare
Akamai
Amazon CloudFront
Google Cloud CDN


he terms major, minor, and patch refer to versioning in software development, typically following the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) system. The format is:

Copy
Edit
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
1. Major Version
Indicates breaking changes that are not backward compatible. Updating to a new major version may require changes to your code.

Example: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
When to increase: If you add features or make changes that break existing functionality.
Example Scenario: Removing or renaming APIs, changing core logic.
2. Minor Version
Represents new features or enhancements that are backward compatible.

Example: 1.1.0 → 1.2.0
When to increase: If you add new functionality without breaking existing ones.
Example Scenario: Adding new methods, improving performance.
3. Patch Version
Indicates bug fixes or small improvements that are backward compatible without changing features.

Example: 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
When to increase: If you fix bugs, security vulnerabilities, or minor issues.
Example Scenario: Fixing a typo, resolving a small bug.
Example Version: 3.5.2
Major = 3: Significant updates with breaking changes.
Minor = 5: New features without breaking existing ones.
Patch = 2: Small bug fixes or performance improvements.
