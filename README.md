# React
My React Journey ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve started my journey to master React, and this repository will document my daily learning progress. My goal is to build a strong foundation in frontend development by understanding Reactâ€™s core concepts and applying them in real-world projects.

I began with the basicsâ€”JSX, components, props, and state. As I progress, I will explore hooks, React Router, context API, and advanced state management techniques. Each day, I will push updates with code snippets, project implementations, and key takeaways. This will not only help me track my progress but also serve as a reference for anyone learning React.

I believe in learning by doing, so expect hands-on projects that showcase different React features. From simple UI components to complex applications, I will continuously challenge myself to improve. I also plan to integrate modern technologies like Redux, Tailwind CSS, and API handling to build scalable and interactive applications.

By consistently pushing updates, I aim to stay accountable and document everything I learn. If you're on a similar journey, feel free to explore my repository, provide feedback, or collaborate. Letâ€™s grow together in the world of web development! ðŸš€
